-   **Filename:** `%ghe VS gdp_capita($).png`
-   **Description:** This scatter plot shows the relationship between the percentage of Government Health Expenditure (`ghe_pof_gdp`) and the GDP per capita (`gdp per capita $`). Each point represents a year's data. The plot helps to visualize if there is a correlation between a country's wealth per person and its government's spending on health.

## 2. Linear Regression: GDP Per Capita and Government Health Expenditure

![Linear Regression Plot](Linear%2520Regression%2520graph%2520on%2520GDP%2520per%2520Capita%2520and%2520%25GDP%2520on%2520Health.png)

-   **Filename:** `Linear Regression graph on GDP per Capita and %GDP on Health.png`
-   **Description:** This plot shows the same data as the scatter plot above, but with a linear regression line of best fit. The line helps to quantify the relationship between GDP per capita and government health expenditure, showing the general trend in the data.
